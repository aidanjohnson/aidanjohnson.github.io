Aidan’s research focuses on deriving the computational principles of sensorimotor behaviour in the context of coordinated flight and multi-agent active sensing. He is broadly interested in the signal processing that occurs within the brain and how the functions of individual neurons are combined for system-level action and perception.</p><br><br><br></div>
