Aidan’s research focuses on deriving the computational principles of sensorimotor behaviour in the context of coordinated flight and multi-agent active sensing. He is broadly interested in the signal processing that occurs within the brain and how the functions of individual neurons are combined for system-level action and perception. He recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> where he received a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.ee.washington.edu">Electrical Engineering</a>.</p></div>
