Aidan’s research focuses on deriving the computational principles of sensorimotor behavior in the context of coordinated flight and multi-agent active sensing. He is broadly interested in the signal processing that occurs within the brain and how the functions of individual neurons are combined for system-level action and perception. He recently graduated from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) where he received a Bachelor of Science in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.washington.edu).</p></div>
